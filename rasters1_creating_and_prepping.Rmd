# Session summary

For this EcoDataScience session, we will cover some basics of working with spatial data presented in a gridded format, i.e., rasters, using the `raster` package.  This is distinct from vector data, such as points, lines, and polygons, which are not constrained to a grid but have problems of their own.  This will be an overview of rasters, introducing basic concepts of creating them, modifying them, and doing basic analyses with them.  This first script focuses on creating and preparing rasters to be used in a simple analysis.

NOTE: This will not use the `stars` package, which is a massive overhaul of raster-style data for R. Because that's still in the development process, and the `raster` package is very mature, we'll use `raster` for this workshop.  But `stars` looks like it's gonna be really cool!

# Creating a raster

As with many things in R, there are many ways to create rasters depending on the information you have to start.  There are several parameters that every raster must have:

* A coordinate reference system (CRS), i.e., a system to locate things spatially on the surface of the earth - basically a definition of the shape of the globe (hint: not a sphere), some way to identify where X = 0 and Y = 0, and quite likely some projection to convert curved space into flat space.  Includes units, often degrees or meters.
* An origin, i.e., what is the spatial coordinate of the grid point closest to (0, 0), sort of like how far is your grid offset from a perfect alignment.
* A resolution, i.e., what is the length of the sides of each grid cell, in both X and Y.  This is in units given in the coordinate reference system.
* An extent, i.e., what are the corners of the box that bounds your raster.

If you want to use multiple rasters in an analysis, these generally all have to match up for all your rasters.

## Creating a raster from X and Y coordinates on a regular grid

``` {r create raster using rasterFromXYZ}
### Read a truncated version of the AquaMaps Half-degree Cell
### Authority File (HCAF) - cell IDs, locations, ocean area, in a dataframe
hcaf_df <- read_csv(here('_data/am_hcaf.csv'))

### View the dataframe - note the different columns included in it.
### LOICZID is "Land Ocean Interactions in the Coastal Zone" cell ID, but
### really just a unique number for each cell.

### create an xyz dataframe for the raster::rasterFromXYZ function.  Use
### loiczid as cell value.
xyz_df <- hcaf_df %>%
  select(x = center_long, y = center_lat, z = loiczid)

hcaf_rast <- raster::rasterFromXYZ(xyz_df)
crs(hcaf_rast) ### oh noes, it's NA, that's no good! set it:
crs(hcaf_rast) <- '+init=epsg:4326'   
  ### or '+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs', same thing

hcaf_rast ### look at the basic info about the raster

plot(hcaf_rast)

writeRaster(hcaf_rast, here('_spatial/hcaf_rast.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Creating a raster from scratch

```{r manually create the same raster from scratch}
hcaf_rast2 <- raster(xmn = -180, xmx = 180, ymn = -90, ymx = 90,
                     res = 0.5,
                     crs = '+init=epsg:4326')

### THe LOICZID values are not tricky - they start at 1 in upper left, increase
### as you moving right, then at the end of the first row, drop to the leftmost
### cell in the second row, etc.  We can fill those values easily:
values(hcaf_rast2) <- 1:ncell(hcaf_rast2)

### NOTE: if you saw the previous gridded climate data workshop, Mike created
### a raster from scratch using a matrix - this filled the values in columns
### (top to bottom), then left to right by column.  This method fills the
### values by row (left to right), then top-to-bottom row by row.
### Which is better?  both are totally arbitrary - use the method that works
### for you (or in this case, matches the dataset you're working with)

hcaf_rast   ### check the parameters of the original one
hcaf_rast2  ### check the parameters of the new one

### check to see whether the two rasters are identical
raster::compareRaster(hcaf_rast, hcaf_rast2, values = TRUE)

### no need to save, we already have one that works just fine...
```

## Use `subs()` to substitute raster cell values for other values in a dataframe

```{r examine ocean area by cell}
ocean_area_df <- hcaf_df %>%
  mutate(pct_ocean = ocean_area / cell_area)

### use raster::subs() to substitute in values to replace others
pct_ocean_rast <- subs(hcaf_rast, ocean_area_df,
                       by = 'loiczid', ### which variable is the key
                       which = 'pct_ocean') ### which var is the new value

pct_ocean_rast
plot(pct_ocean_rast)

writeRaster(pct_ocean_rast, here('_spatial/ocean_rast.tif'),
            overwrite = TRUE)
```

Note: we could have used `rasterFromXYZ()` here too, simply using `x` = longitude, y` = latitude, and percent ocean area as the `z` value.

# Practice with `subs()` on real data

The nice thing about `raster::subs()` is that we can do a lot of work in the Tidyverse and then simply plop the results into a previously generated raster, based on cell IDs.

Load and examine the AquaMaps information on sharks, as dataframes:

* taxonomic information on sharks found in the region
* a lookup table that maps shark species IDs to cell IDs
* NOTE: these are trimmed down from the full AquaMaps dataset for size, so they don't fill up the whole map, and only include shark species.

``` {r load shark species data and cell info}
### taxonomic info on shark species within southeastern Africa EEZs
am_spp_info <- read_csv(here('_data/am_shark_info.csv'))
### species ID to cell probability lookup table - maps species to cells
am_spp_cells <- read_csv(here('_data/am_shark_cells.csv'))
```

### Scalloped hammerhead range
![](img/hh.jpg)

```{r use subs to examine the range for scalloped hammerhead}
### View am_spp_info and search to find ID for "scalloped hammerhead" and
hh_id <- 'Fis-23273'
hh_cells_df <- am_spp_cells %>%
  filter(am_sid == hh_id)

### use raster::subs() to substitute in values for others
hh_range_rast <- subs(hcaf_rast, hh_cells_df,
                      by = 'loiczid', ### which variable is the key
                      which = 'prob') ### which var is the new value
plot(hh_range_rast)

### that's way more map space than we need!  raster::trim() can trim it to remove
### the whitespace
hh_range_rast <- hh_range_rast %>%
  raster::trim()

hh_range_rast
plot(hh_range_rast)
writeRaster(hh_range_rast, here('_spatial/hammerhead_rast.tif'),
            overwrite = TRUE)
```

### Silky shark range

![](img/ss.jpg)
```{r use subs to examine the range for silky shark}
### View am_spp_info and search to find ID for "silky shark" and
ss_id <- 'Fis-23054'
ss_cells_df <- am_spp_cells %>%
  filter(am_sid == ss_id)

### use raster::subs() to substitute in values for others
ss_range_rast <- subs(hcaf_rast, ss_cells_df,
                      by = 'loiczid',         ### which variable is the key
                      which = 'prob') %>%     ### which var is the new value
  trim()
plot(ss_range_rast)

writeRaster(ss_range_rast, here('_spatial/silkyshark_rast.tif'),
            overwrite = TRUE)
```


# Reprojecting a raster

Often we are given a raster in a resolution and/or coordinate reference system that is different from our other sources of data.  We can reproject a raster to new parameters (origin, resolution, extent, and CRS) using `raster::projectRaster()`.  Note, for vector data, we can use `st_transform` (if using `sf` spatial formats) or `spTransform` (if using `rgdal`/`sp` spatial formats)

Our AquaMaps data is in a generic lat-long format, but for Mozambique, they prefer to use a different CRS.  Since the results will be used by WCS scientists in Mozambique, let's use the Mozambique preferred CRS.  We will create a new base raster for analysis, at a 10 km resolution equal area, in the same CRS as provided by WCS in a shapefile of SE Africa EEZs.

``` {r reproject wgs84 raster to mozambique crs}
se_afr_eez_sf <- read_sf(here('_spatial/moz_eez', 'se_afr_eez.shp'))
# crs(se_afr_eez_sf) 
# [1] "+proj=cea +lat_ts=30 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs"
# crs(hcaf_rast) 
# CRS arguments: +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs

### First, trim the global hcaf raster down to the same extent as our range map
hcaf_rast_crop <- raster::crop(hcaf_rast, hh_range_rast)

### Next use raster::projectRaster to change the CRS and resolution
hcaf_rast_reproj <- projectRaster(hcaf_rast_crop, 
                                  method = 'ngb',
                                  crs = crs(se_afr_eez_sf),
                                  res = 10000)
# hcaf_rast_crop
# hcaf_rast_reproj
plot(hcaf_rast_reproj)

writeRaster(hcaf_rast_reproj, here('_spatial/hcaf_rast_6933.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)

```

And important understanding: we've reprojected half-degree cells (around 55 km x 55 km at the equator), each with a unique cell ID, to 10 km x 10 km cells.  These new smaller cells are diced versions of the larger cells, but still contain the same cell IDs as the original larger cell, because we used "nearest neighbor" i.e., `method = "ngb"`.

```{r compare low-res to high-res versions for cell counts}
values_lo_res <- values(hcaf_rast_crop)
### make a table of number of cells for each values; use 'head()' just to see 
### the first 20 instances
table(values_lo_res) %>% head(20)
### one cell per cell ID value

values_hi_res <- values(hcaf_rast_reproj)
table(values_hi_res) %>% head(20)
### between 24 and 30 cells per cell ID value
```

We can see there are (at least for these first few cell IDs) 24 or 30 new 10km x 10km cells from each old 0.5° x 0.5° cell.

# Plotting with rasters

We've been using the base `plot` function to plot our rasters.  It works fine, but is not fancy.  We'll keep using that for simple plots, but we can also use `ggplot2` to plot our rasters, using the `geom_raster()` function.  However, we can't just plop in the raster itself - we have to turn it into a dataframe of coordinates (`ggplot2` likes dataframes!).  Just as before we used `rasterFromXYZ`, here we can use `rasterToPoints()` to go the other direction.

Note `geom_sf` works with simple features polygons just fine.  But high resolution polygons take a while to plot.  Here we're using a very simplified EEZ shapefile for speed.

``` {r reproject hammerhead range and plot it}
### Let's transform the hammerhead range to the Mozambique CRS.
### could do either of these:
### * projectRaster() from half-degree cells to 10 km cells
### * subs() into the new projected hcaf 10 km cell raster, using the cell IDs
hh_range_reproj <- subs(hcaf_rast_reproj, hh_cells_df, 
                        by = 'loiczid', which = 'prob')

### plot this using ggplot, and add the EEZ layer on top.  First,
### need to turn the raster into a dataframe...
hh_range_df <- raster::rasterToPoints(hh_range_reproj) %>%
  as.data.frame()

ggplot() +
  geom_raster(data = hh_range_df, aes(x, y, fill = prob)) +
  geom_sf(data = se_afr_eez_sf, color = 'red', fill = NA)

```

## Creating a `plot_rast()` function

Because I'd like to keep plotting rasters with polygons on top for reference, I will create a function to let me use a single line of code.

``` {r set up plot_rast utility function}
### The above lines of code to plot the raster with the sf 
### are coded into a function here, for future ease of use:
plot_rast <- function(rast, sf) {
  ### function to plot a raster with a simple features border overlaid
  rast_crs <- as.character(crs(rast))
  sf_crs <- as.character(crs(sf))
  ### error check: make sure CRS are equal
  # if(rast_crs != sf_crs) {
  #   error_msg <- sprintf('CRS mismatch!\n    raster: %s\n    sf: %s',
  #                        as.character(crs(rast)), crs(sf))
  #   stop(error_msg) ### stops everything and communicates an error
  # }
  
  fill_name <- names(rast)
  ### convert raster to points
  rast_df <- rasterToPoints(rast) %>%
    as.data.frame() %>%
    setNames(c('x', 'y', 'z'))
  
  ### ggplot the raster points and the simple features
  x <- ggplot() +
    geom_raster(data = rast_df, aes(x, y, fill = z)) +
    geom_sf(data = sf, color = 'red', fill = NA) +
    labs(fill = fill_name)
  
  return(x)
}

plot_rast(hh_range_reproj, se_afr_eez_sf)
```

Note that the square cells don't line up well with the smoother coastline...

# Rasterizing polygons

There are several ways to turn a polygon into a raster, but we will need to know the target parameters (origin, resolution, extent, CRS).  Often we will already have these inside an existing raster object.

Let's make a mask of just the Mozambique EEZ, and clip this regional raster down to just that.  We will use `fasterize::fasterize()`, but could also do with `raster::rasterize()`.  `rasterize()` used to have some bugs in it, and may still, so I tend to prefer `fasterize()`.  

NOTE: `fasterize()` works with simple features `sf` objects, and must be provided a raster template, while `rasterize()` can work on older `sp` objects and allows you many ways to set the target parameters.

```{r create mozambique eez mask}
moz_eez_sf <- se_afr_eez_sf %>%
  filter(territory == 'Mozambique')

### default is to convert any cells that fall within a polygon to a value
### of 1.  The "field" function lets us choose a value within the attribute
### table to assign to the cells.  Here let's use the "id" field.
se_afr_eez_rast <- fasterize(se_afr_eez_sf, hcaf_rast_reproj, field = 'id')

plot_rast(se_afr_eez_rast, moz_eez_sf)
writeRaster(se_afr_eez_rast, here('_spatial/se_afr_eez_6933.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)

### Use mask to keep only cells that occur in (i.e., non-NA) SE African EEZs
hh_range_se_afr <- raster::mask(hh_range_reproj, se_afr_eez_rast)

plot_rast(hh_range_se_afr, moz_eez_sf)
writeRaster(hh_range_se_afr, here('_spatial/hh_rast_6933.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)
```

Let's create a masked range raster for the silky shark, like we did for the hammerhead.  Last time we used `subs()`; this time let's use `projectRaster()` and then mask it, and write it out.

This time, however, our data is not cell IDs (discrete), but probabilities (continuous).  Because of that, perhaps we would like to let R interpolate values for intermediate cells to smooth the map.  Last time we used the nearest neighbor (`'ngb'`) to maintain the discrete values, but here let's use `method = 'bilinear'`.

```{r make a masked range raster for silky shark}
### Note, there are gaps in its range, where
### probability is zero - but they show up as NA.  Let's replace all NAs with
### zero first, then mask, so land will go back to NA.
x <- values(ss_range_rast) ### values accesses the raster values as a vector
### identify the indices in the vector where NA, and replace with zero
values(ss_range_rast)[is.na(values(ss_range_rast))] <- 0
plot_rast(ss_range_rast, moz_eez_sf)

### now reproject, crop
ss_range_se_afr <- projectRaster(ss_range_rast, hcaf_rast_reproj, method = 'bilinear') %>%
  mask(se_afr_eez_rast)
plot_rast(ss_range_se_afr, moz_eez_sf)
### compare ngb and bilinear

writeRaster(ss_range_se_afr, here('_spatial/ss_rast_6933.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)
```

## Rasterizing other types of vector data

We can also rasterize vector data as lines and points.  Let's rasterize a shapefile of points indicating Mozambique ports, using our reprojected AquaMaps LOICZID raster.  

* Unfortunately `fasterize` only works on `sf` polygons and multipolygons, so we will use the `raster::rasterize` function instead.  
* But the `rasterize` function needs an older spatial format (Spatial or `sp`), so we'll resort to old-school functions to read in the points.  
* The `sf::as()` function is great for coercing `sf` simple features to `sp` Spatial objects as in this situation, when `sf` just won't do.

```{r}
ports_sf <- read_sf(here('_spatial/moz_ports/Moz_ports_updated.shp'))
class(ports_sf) 
### [1] "sf"         "tbl_df"     "tbl"        "data.frame"
st_crs(ports_sf)
### in generic lat-long, 4326.  Need to transform it to the Mozambique CRS
ports_sf <- ports_sf %>%
  st_transform(crs = st_crs(moz_eez_sf))

ports_sp <- as(ports_sf, 'Spatial')
class(ports_sp)
### [1] "SpatialPointsDataFrame"
### attr(,"package")
### [1] "sp"
crs(ports_sp)

ports_rast <- raster::rasterize(ports_sp, hcaf_rast_reproj, field = 'OBJECTID_1')
plot_rast(ports_rast, moz_eez_sf)
writeRaster(ports_rast, here('_spatial/moz_ports_6933.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)
```

The points are there, but they're really small!

# More `subs()` with a simple analysis

Let's make a species richness map, by counting how many distinct shark species can be found in each cell.  To do this, we can use the dataframe of shark species to cells, `am_spp_cells`.  For each cell, we can count up how many distinct species IDs occur.  Assign this to the 0.5° cells, then reproject with `method = 'bilinear'`, and write it out.

Note: let's say for a shark species to count in a cell, there must be greater than 50% probability.

``` {r species richness map}
### map out the shark species richness
shark_richness_df <- am_spp_cells %>%
  filter(prob >= .50) %>%
  group_by(loiczid) %>%
  summarize(n_sharks = n_distinct(am_sid))

shark_richness_rast <- raster::subs(hcaf_rast, shark_richness_df, 
                                    by = 'loiczid', which = 'n_sharks') %>%
  projectRaster(hcaf_rast_reproj, method = 'bilinear') %>%
  mask(se_afr_eez_rast)

plot_rast(shark_richness_rast, moz_eez_sf)
writeRaster(shark_richness_rast, here('_spatial/spp_richness_6933.tif'), overwrite = TRUE)
```

# Review: what have we done so far?

* created a raster from evenly-spaced lat-long data
* created a raster from scratch by directly giving parameters - an extent/bounding box (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax), resolution, and CRS
* added a coordinate reference system to a raster, and checked it.
* used `raster::subs()` to substitute desired values into a raster, replacing cell ID values
* plotted a raster quickly using base plot function.
* used `raster::trim()` to remove excess NA values (i.e. whitespace border) from a raster
* used `raster::projectRaster()` to reproject an existing raster to the parameters (extent, origin, resolution, CRS) of a different raster
* plotted a raster using `ggplot2::geom_raster()` by converting the raster to a dataframe
* plotted a simple features polygon on top of the raster using `ggplot2::geom_sf()`
